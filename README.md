About this project
This project is focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions from a dataset of credit card transactions.

The steps involved in this project include:

Data Loading and Exploration: Loading the credit card transaction dataset and exploring its characteristics, including the distribution of fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions.
Data Analysis and Visualization: Performing data analysis and visualizing key aspects of the data, such as correlations between features.
Feature Importance and Selection: Identifying and selecting the most important features for the model.
Data Splitting: Splitting the data into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.
Model Selection and Training: Choosing and training appropriate machine learning models, such as Decision Trees and Random Forests.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the model's performance through hyperparameter tuning.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the trained model using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.
